# Psych-Stream
Apptitude Project

Hello,
We have developed an app for streaming any video URL without using any external API's 
Access to this app is via biometric authentication

First, the user has sign-in into the app by using any of the registered fingerprints.
After the sign-in is successful , the streaming activity will be opened.
Just paste the link in the textbox and click on stream.
To stream again repeat the above step !

If multiple failed attempts of biometric is detected, there is a timedelay before you can sign-in again into the app.

Hope you like our Project.
